            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p><b><em>BUDDHA</em> also known as Siddhartha Gautama, was a revered spiritual teacher and the founder of Buddhism. 
                Born in the 6th century BCE in Lumbini, now part of modern-day Nepal, he lived a life of luxury as a prince. 
                However, seeking a deeper understanding of human suffering, he renounced his princely life and embarked on a spiritual journey.
                 After years of meditation and contemplation, he attained enlightenment under the Bodhi tree in Bodh Gaya, India. 
                 Buddha's teachings, encapsulated in the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path, emphasize the pursuit of inner peace, compassion, 
                 and liberation from the cycle of birth and death. His profound wisdom and teachings have left an indelible mark on the world, 
                 shaping the spiritual and philosophical landscape for centuries..</p>
